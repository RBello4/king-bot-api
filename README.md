travian games threatened to sue me if i will not remove the bot from github.  
since i live in germany i have to take this seriously. you would be save in any other country tho.

i removed a lot of core files as being told to, so the bot will not work anymore.  

__a big thanks to everyone who is part of the awesome community i got on discord due to this bot <3__
